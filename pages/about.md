Hi,
we think every coaster youtuber has one problem: finding a good non copyright onride of a coaster for a video. But we have a solution for that problem: the RCOD (roller coaster onride database), a place where everyone can search after non copyright onrides and use them in their own videos.
This site was created by two coaster enthusiasts who found out that a website like this doesn't exist at this moment so they want to realize it.
